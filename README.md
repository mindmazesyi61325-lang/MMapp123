# MindMaze — Prototype

This repository contains a small prototype of the MindMaze web app (landing, age confirmation, simple dashboard, journal persistence).

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- This is a minimal prototype to explore flows and UI. Not production-ready.
- Data is stored in `localStorage` for the prototype (no server).
